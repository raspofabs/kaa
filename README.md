# Kaa - the python tree sitter code analyser for C++

Primarily, this package is just to find a way to gather the static-path-count
of C++ code, but perhaps it will grow later.

## Installation

This is a poetry based package, so downloading the repo and running

```
pip install kaa
```

Should do the trick, and then you can use it:

```
kaa_spc <path_to_your_cpp_file>
```
