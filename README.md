# Kaa - the python tree sitter code analyser for C++

Primarily, this package is just to find a way to gather the static-path-count
of C++ code, but perhaps it wil grow later.

## Todo

- [ ] run on some larger code and find the broken bits
    - tried the Gilded Rose kata, which was good as the complexity is over 200.
    - [ ] other katas?
    - [ ] other public git stuff?
